This is the Udacity Kinematics Project for Term 1 of the Sofware Robotics Nanodegree Program. 

**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**
1) **Forward Kinematics Model** The first purpose of the project was to calculate the forward kinematic model

2) **Inverse Kinematic model** The IK model allowed the robot to identify location of an object on a shelf, approach and pick up object, calculate a trajectory path to a destination (a bin in this case) and follow the path to drop object in bin. The success metric was 8/10 on object identification, pick up and place in bin. The object appeared in at each attempt randomly at 9 different shelf locations.
