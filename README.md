# RoboND-Kinematics-Project
Pick and Place project for RoboND Term 1

This is the Udacity Kinematics Project for Term 1 of the Sofware Robotics Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project was to calculate the forward and inverse kinematic model for the robot to identify location of an object on a shelf, approach and pick up object, calculate a trajectory path to a destination (a bin in this case) and follow the path to drop object in bin. The success metric was 8/10 on object identification, pick up and place in bin. The object appeared in at each attempt randomly at 9 different shelf locations.

The forward kinematics established the end effector position and allowed us to be able to define a inverse kinematic model.
